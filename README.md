# Handing over WP4 in FUNDER

Here, I have gathered information about sampling, lab work and status of samples/datasets to make an easy transition for the person who is taking over my work in the FUNDER project.

Since datasets are not yet published, they will be shared with project participants on other, non-public platforms.

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
